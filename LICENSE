Most of this code belongs to: https://github.com/jadpole/jadpole.github.io & this is his disclaimer:

Legal stuff

After being asked about it a few times, I thought I’d include a little disclaimer:

You can use the code we’re writing in this tutorial for whatever purpose you have, whether in a personal project or a commercial one.
I would like to note, however, that I do not encourage it — not because of copyright stuff, but simply because I’m building this project with pedagogy in mind, not performance or maintainability.

THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE GAME’S ASSETS, which I’ve mostly taken from google and Mike Geig’s course to save time.
I might bother to replace those by custom resources one day. Until then, though, you shouldn’t use those in your projects, just in case.
